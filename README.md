# tanakh-talmud-dataset
Some datasets of the Tanakh and Talmud

More to come here soon, right now the repo contains two files:

# tanakh-text.csv
The complete text of the Tanakh, according to the Leningrad Codex, from the data at https://tanach.us

# talmud-bavli-tanakh-links.csv
References to verses from the Talmud Bavli. This is based on the "Links" stored in Sefaria, so
it covers more than just citatations in the Talmud text.

The column headings should be pretty self-descriptive. The "Section" column is the section numbering used
in Sefaria.

The data for this CSV comes from:
* Tanakh verses: https://tanach.us
* References: The "links" provided by Sefaria in their publicly available data dumps.

If you have questions/suggestions, please open Issues or Pull Requests.
If you'd like to see the same data in a different flatfile format, let me know... though you
should also check out what Sefaria provides, because they might have what you're looking for.
